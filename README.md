# ANTI-THEFT-VEHICLE-DETECTION-WITH-OBSTACLE-DETECTION
Anti-Theft Vehicle Detection System uses face recognition to start the vehicle, replacing traditional keys. Built with Raspberry Pi and OpenCV, it triggers a buzzer and emails the owner if unauthorized access is detected. GPS and Wi-Fi enable real-time alerts, ensuring enhanced vehicle security and obstacle detection.
